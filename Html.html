<p>BMX</p>
<p>Though originally denoting a bicycle intended for BMX racing, the term "BMX bike" is now used to encompass race bikes, as well as those used for the dirt, vert, park, street, <br>flatland and BMX freestyle disciplines <br>of BMX. BMX frames are made of various types<br> of steel, and (largely in the racing category) aluminum or carbon. Cheaper, low-end bikes are usually made <br>of steel. High-range bikes are mostly chromoly or high<br> tensile steel, although the latter is noticeably heavier with respect to strength.<br> High-performance BMX bikes use lightweight 4130 chromoly, or generation 3 chromoly.[1].</p>

<p>trial bike</p>
<p>Mountain bike trials, also known as observed trials, is a discipline of mountain biking in which the<br> rider attempts to pass through an obstacle course without setting foot<br> to ground. Derived from motorcycle trials,1 it originated in Catalonia, Spain as trialsín (from trial sin motor, "motorcycle trials without an engine") <br>and is said to have been invented by Pere Pi,<br> the father of Ot Pi, a world champion motorcycle trials rider. Pi's father had <br>wanted his son to learn motorcycle trials by practicing on an ordinary bicycle.</p>
